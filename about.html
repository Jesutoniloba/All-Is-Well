          <h2>What We Believe</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The Bible is the inspired Word of God.</li>
            <li>
              There is only one God, eternally existent in three persons:
              Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
            </li>
            <li>
              Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who died for our sins and rose
              again.
            </li>
            <li>
              Salvation is available to all who repent and believe in Christ.
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe in the power of the Holy Spirit, divine healing, and
              holy living.
